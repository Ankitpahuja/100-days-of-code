# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: June 8th, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: I learned the basic understanding/working of git and github.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with Git and Github, I have watched a hell lot of tutorials and infact some tutorials from the official channel but i am not convinced. This guy helped me a lot in learning GitHub and Version control (Git)!

**Link to work:** [This guy's Git and Github Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&index=1&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV)

**Topics/Terminologies Learned:** I know a lot about the following topics now:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>Version Control</li>
<li>Repository/Repo</li>
<li>Commit (hash - key allocated to every commit!)</li>
<li>Branch</li>
<li>Merge</li>
<li>Pull Request</li>
</ul>
