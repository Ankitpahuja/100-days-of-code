# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 8th, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: I learned the basic understanding/working of git and github.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with Git and Github, I have watched a hell lot of tutorials and infact some tutorials from the official channel but i am not convinced. This guy helped me a lot in learning GitHub and Version control (Git)!
