# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: June 8th, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: I learned the basic understanding/working of git and github.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with Git and Github, I have watched a hell lot of tutorials and infact some tutorials from the official channel but i am not convinced. This guy helped me a lot in learning GitHub and Version control (Git)!

**Topics/Terminologies Learned:** I know a lot about the following topics now:
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>Version Control</li>

## Day 1: June 11th, 2017 
**Today's Progress**: I learned the basic HTML.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled finding the right resources for learning web dev, I have watched a hell lot of tutorials and infact some tutorials from the official channel but i was not convinced. Started a course on udemy (link is in the description) + Free code camp (FCC) - First 30 tasks/jobs completed. I think these two resources along with the documentation of WEB - W3CSchool will get me the desired technologies under my stack.
